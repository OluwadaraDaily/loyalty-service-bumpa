# Loyalty Service - Backend API

Documentation for Backend

## Design Choices

### Architecture Overview

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: As requested in the assessment, I implemented an event-driven architecture where purchase events trigger achievement/badge unlocking and cashback processing through Laravel's event system
- **Service Layer Pattern**: I ensured that dedicated services (LoyaltyService, CashbackService, MockPaymentService) encapsulate business logic and that they were separated to make sure concerns are separate.
- **Laravel Sanctum**: Token-based authentication for both session and API authentication. This is the recommended way to handle auth in Laravel, I went with it.
- **MySQL Database**: I used MySQL because of scalability in the design.
- **Nginx**: I added Nginx in the Docker to help with security concerns in production (if it ever gets there...)

### Core Services

1. **LoyaltyService**: Processes purchase events, evaluates achievements, unlocks badges, and triggers cashback
2. **CashbackService**: Handles cashback calculations and mock payment processing with retry mechanisms
3. **MockPaymentService**: Simulates real payment provider with configurable success/failure rates. I opted for this rather than integration to Paystack/Flutterwave because of time constraints
4. **InMemoryQueueService**: Manages event queue processing for testing purposes. Like above, I had issues inetgrating with Kafka, as such, I implemented an in-memory queue.

### Badge-Achievement Relationship

I came up with this relationship between badges and achievements. Badges are unlocked when users complete specific combinations of achievements. Each badge requires a set of achievements to be completed, creating a progression system where individual achievements lead to badge rewards:

- **Bronze Badge**: Requires 1 achievement
- **Silver Badge**: Requires 2 achievements  
- **Gold Badge**: Requires all 4 achievements

### Purchase Flow

1. User makes purchase â†’ Purchase record created
2. System evaluates all achievements against user's progress
3. Newly unlocked achievements trigger badge evaluation
4. Eligible cashback calculated based on achievements/badges unlocked
5. Events fired (AchievementUnlocked, BadgeUnlocked)
6. Cashback payment initiated through mock payment service

## How to Setup Project

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- SQLite (default) or MySQL

### Non-Docker Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

2. **Environment Setup**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

3. **Database Setup**

```bash
# Create SQLite database
touch database/database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed with sample data (admin user, test users, achievements, badges)
php artisan db:seed --class=LoyaltySystemSeeder
```

4. **Start Development Server**

```bash
# Option 1: All services (recommended)
composer run dev

# Option 2: Manual startup
php artisan serve &
php artisan queue:listen &
npm run dev
```

**Application URLs:**

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>

### Docker Setup

For complete Docker setup instructions including all services (MySQL, Kafka, Redis, Nginx), see [README-Docker.md](README-Docker.md).

### Sample Data Created

- **Admin User**: <admin@loyalty.com> / password
- **Test Users**: <user1@test.com>, <user2@test.com> / password
- **4 Achievements**: First Purchase, Big Spender, Loyal Customer, Weekend Warrior
- **3 Badges**: Bronze, Silver, Gold with different achievement requirements

## How to Run Tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test suites
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage

# Run specific test files
php artisan test tests/Feature/Api/UserAchievementApiTest.php
php artisan test tests/Unit/Services/LoyaltyServiceTest.php
```
